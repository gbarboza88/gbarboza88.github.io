I made this blog to showcase some personal projects. Most are related to QA but not all of them.

I hope some posts I do can help other QA Game Testers to understand more about technical aspects of games and how they mix skill with creativity to find problems.

I may also post some guides related to QA Tools like JIRA/Testrail.
