It affects all firmware versions and is essentialy unpatchable, the only way Sony can “patch it” is by removing the game OKAGE:Shadow King from the PlayStation Store, as the exploit relies on this game.</p>

<p>The concept of the glitch is that by extended the player’s name, it is possible to create a stack buffer overflow, thus allowing to custom code execution. It is necessary to have a save modified with the application on the console that will be triggered when the game loads your save. After the exploit is triggered, you are asked to send the ISO to the console through your PC. For this you use a Python script, type IP of your console followed by the name of the ISO, simple as that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this exploit has bad compatibility with a lot of PS2 games, leading them to crash as soon as they are transferred or they are unplayable (because graphics are glitched or the game crashes when you perform an action that is necessary to play the game).</p>

<p>Even with its bad compatibility, I wanted to test out as many PS2 games as possible. I like the fact of playing PS2 games on PS4, Sony should provide a larger library so that this is not the only way to play these old games on newer hardware (with latest firmware).</p>

<p>In order to make testing games easier, I developed a web application that lets me run the python script on the PC. The application get all the ISOs in the folder automatically shows their cover art (retrieved from xlenore’s repository) and when the user clicks on the cover of the wanted game, the command python script is triggered and the ISO is sent. The real challenge was to make this web application work inside the PS4’s browser, as it does not support many modern web features and has horrible performance. After trying several alternatives to host a local page that the PS2 can access, the only thing that work was hosting a Jupyter Notebook and make an interface for it using Voila extension. The notebook looks at the root folder, search for ISO files, open them to search for the game ID (e.g SLUS-97392 = Shinobi), stores this ID and formats the python command needed to send the ISO. Retrieves game’s covers based on their ISO ID through xlernore’s repository, then it associates said python command to its respective cover and executes it everytime the user clicks on it. The final product was pretty much what I wanted, you can bookmark the page on PS4’s browser for easy access and use it to play your PS2 library without typing any instruction on PC. All covers are resized automatically to have the same. Each row can hold up to 4 PS2 covers. Here is the link to the compatibility list: Okage Compatibility List</p>

We used to play Tag Team mode (2v2) with a mechanic called “Revenge Cart” turned on. This mechanic basically allowed a player to have a second chance of returning to the battlefield by putting its character on top of a cart that could move around the corner of the stage. While on top of your cart, you could throw bombs in the players that were still alive and, if you manage to get a kill, you would respawn. The glitch happened because of that mechanic.</p>

<p>I was on top of the missile while my duo was fighting in the battlefield. Same situation for the other team, one player downed (on top of the cart) and the other one on the battlefield. So basically, one player of each team on the battlefield and one player of each team on cart. My teammate ended up dying to a bomb of the cart player of the other team (leading to this player respawing), but while my teammate was in the animation frames of dying, I managed to score a kill on the oponnent that was on the battlefield, so I respawned too.</p>

<p>The expected behaviour in a situation like this one is for the game to simply keep things going, one player of each team is alive and only one can be the winner, but what happened is that both me and my opponent triggered the animation victory but my team was the one that received the trophy in the end (thankfully).</p>

<p>I remembered this situation recently and now a days, with more knowledge and tools that help testing out those situations, I tried to recreate the glitch and take a better look at it.</p>

<h2 id="trying-to-reproduce-the-bug">Trying to Reproduce the Bug</h2>
<p>I recreated the situation using Mesen emulator and the feature Frame Advance, allowing me to make precise inputs the frame I want and advance frame-by-frame to see the results. In order to decide the teams, Super Bomberman 5 shows two rows for you to organize which players belong to which team. We will call the top row Team A and the bottom one Team B.</p>

<figure class="row">
    
    <div class="column">
        <img class="single" src="/Type-on-Strap/assets/img/feature-img/bomberman5charaselect.jpg" alt="bomberman5charaselect.jpg" />
    </div>
    
    
    <figcaption class="caption-style">A caption under the images</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>No matter which team got the kill first from the missile, the trophy always goes to Team B. A bomb thrown from the missile takes about ~15 frames to hit the ground and become active, once active, it always explodes after a certain time (time is always the same). Bomb explosion hitbox activates frame 4 (independent of its range) and after it hits a character, it will only trigger the invincibility frames of the oponnent’s winning animation after 35 frames.</p>

<p>If both players from the cart throw a bomb at the exact same frame and get a kill from the only person alive from the opposite team, they are going to respawn 47 frames after the kill and the game won’t glitch. One frame earlier or late and the glitch happens, caused by the window before the invencibility frames of the players are triggered.</p>

<p>I tried then to switch teams: Bomberman and Dave Bomber (Red Guy) are Team A, Bomber Woof and Gary Bomber (Blue Guy) are Team B. Used the same method and then…, trophy went to Team A. Now things changed, and for worse. . Is it a character specific thing? If it is I will need to test all characters and see which one is better than the other? That is going to be a lot of work but I am determined to discover why this glitch happens.</p>

<h2 id="results-and-conclusion">Results and Conclusion</h2>
<p>After several tests among the cast, I thought I got. It seemed that it was character specific, after testing several different characters combinations things started to follow a certain path and when I thought I figured it out, at the last test, the result breaks pattern that was being build and throw all the results of my tests in the trash.</p>

<p>Then I thought about port priority, there were other games I saw that behaved differently depending on the port the player used (Smash Bros Melee is an example), so I thought it was worth a try. I kept testing for a couple of hours and that seems to be the issue, the game prioritizes ports in the following order: Port 4 &gt; Port 3 &gt; Port 2 &gt; Port 1. So, if player a team is composed by player 3 and player 4, they will always have advantage when one of them respawns from the cart (even if their duo died some frames prior to the respawn). The priority applies for the player that gets the kill.</p>

<p>This situation is unlikely but it led to a really good moment when it happened while I was playing. I will certainly take a look at the other games of this franchise and seek for other glitches on them.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Highlight" /><category term="Markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was kid, there was one day that me and my three cousins were playing Super Bomberman 5 for the Super Famicom and a weird glitch happened.

<p>This is an idea that came from <a href="https://github.com/xukimseven/HardCandy-Jekyll">xukimseven/HardCandy-Jekyll</a> 
looking at this cheerful and colorful theme, I wanted to enable something similar for Type-on-Strap.</p>

<p>You can go fork and star <em>HardCandy-Jekyll</em> too! 😉</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Basically you need to add just one thing, the color:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Color Post</span>
<span class="na">color</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">brown</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It can either be a html color like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brown</code> (which look like red to me). Or with the rgb:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Color Post</span>
<span class="na">color</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">rgb(165,42,42)</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The background used is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lineart.png</code> from <a href="https://github.com/xukimseven">xukimseven</a> you can edit it in the config file. 
If you want another one, put it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/img</code> as well.</p>

This is an example of a post which includes a feature image specified in the front matter of the post. 
The feature image spans the full-width of the page, and is shown with the title on permalink pages:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">feature-img</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">assets/img/feature-img/desk-messy.jpeg"</span>
<span class="na">thumbnail</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">assets/img/thumbnails/feature-img/desk-messy.jpeg"</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also use a thumbnail, a smaller version of the same image to improve loading of the page.
The thumbnail will also be used when you share your article on other platform (linkedin, whatsapp, facebook, …).</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>And now it is working</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also add images aligned in your post using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aligner</code> include.
Make sure to separate all of the image path from in a string separated with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code>.
It by default look into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/img/</code> so give the path from there, example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="p">{</span><span class="sx">% include </span><span class="n">aligner</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">html</span> <span class="n">images</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"pexels/book-glass.jpeg,triangle.png"</span> <span class="n">caption</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"A caption under the images"</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure class="row">
    
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/Type-on-Strap/assets/img/pexels/book-glass.jpeg" alt="book-glass.jpeg" />
    </div>
    
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/Type-on-Strap/assets/img/feature-img/desk-messy.jpeg" alt="desk-messy.jpeg" />
    </div>
    
    
    <figcaption class="caption-style">A caption under the images</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here you have two images side by side, but you can set more and set the amount per columns 
(by specifying the number of columns or let it be automatic using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"auto"</code>):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="p">{</span><span class="sx">% include </span><span class="n">aligner</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">html</span> <span class="n">images</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"portfolio/cabin.png,portfolio/cake.png,portfolio/circus.png"</span> <span class="n">column</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure class="row">
    
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/Type-on-Strap/assets/img/portfolio/cabin.png" alt="cabin.png" />
    </div>
    
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/Type-on-Strap/assets/img/portfolio/cake.png" alt="cake.png" />
    </div>
    
    <div class="column">

    </div>
    
    
    <figcaption class="caption-style"></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>it also works with only one images, it is made to display it smaller than normally.
However you can just use the Markdown way of doing it to get the image normal sized and centered.</p>

<p>All the above was custom HTML with Bootstrap.
You can also mix it up with some markdown.</p>

<p>You can use the bootstrap’s build in javascript API to control your event.
Here is a code snippet for the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/javascript/">documentation</a>:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">#myModal</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">show.bs.modal</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nf">function </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">preventDefault</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">// stops modal from being shown</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s just for demo though, you would need to properly integrate your javascript in your page.
Usually you would put any custom javascript script in the <em>assets</em> folder under js and reference it in your page from there.</p>

<p>So try it out using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bootstrap: true</code> flag! 😉</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Demo" /><category term="Test" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This theme is compatible with Bootstrap if you choose to use it in your pages or posts.

<p>Diagrams with mermaid, make sure it is enabled in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>.
Here is a simple example:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">&lt;!-- To generate a diagram --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"mermaid"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
sequenceDiagram
    Alice-&gt;&gt;John: Hello John, how are you?
    John--&gt;&gt;Alice: Great!
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 Now render also work with the GitHub markdown highlight.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span class="p">```</span><span class="nl">mermaid
</span><span class="sb">sequenceDiagram
    Alice-&gt;&gt;John: Hello John, how are you?
    John--&gt;&gt;Alice: Great!</span>
<span class="p">```</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That will be rendered into this:</p>

<figure class="row">
    
    <div class="column">
        <img class="single" src="/Type-on-Strap/assets/img/mermaid-example.png" alt="mermaid-example.png" />

and try it out with the <a href="https://mermaid.live/">live editor</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/Type-on-Strap/assets/img/pexels/book-glass.jpeg" alt="Image of a glass on a book" /></p>

<p>This is another example of list:</p>

<p>Type on Strap uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as \(S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\) can be displayed inline.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:</p>

\[f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2}\]

<p>And in your markdown file:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$$ f(x) = <span class="se">\i</span>nt <span class="se">\f</span>rac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$

text, where you don’t want to redisplay the title.
Mind your image size in order for the text to be displayed where you want it to.

<p>Here is how the yaml looks inside the post:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may wonder, why is there a title when you are not actually displaying it. <br />
Well that’s due to some jekyll limitation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You <strong>can’t</strong> set the <strong>title</strong> to the <strong>empty string</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The title is used elsewhere than inside the post, for example in the blog page that list this post.
An empty title would break those pages and possibly prevents jekyll to render your blog.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mhagnumdw</name></author><category term="Test" /><category term="Image" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an example of a post which includes a feature image that has a text, where you don’t want to redisplay the title.

<p>“But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?”</p>

<p>“At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat.”</p>

<p>“On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Demo" /><category term="Image" /><category term="Color" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lorem Ipsum from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” written by Cicero in 45 BC.]]></summary></entry></feed>
